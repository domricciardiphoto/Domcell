These amazing LEDs are able to distinguish themselves from other LEDs due to their ability to turn themselves on and off independently. Since each LED can do this, these TVs can achieve better black levels and more crisp contrast when compared to other TVs. These TVs also tend to be able to display brighter colors, and have better viewing angles than your average TV, making your favorite TV shows and movies look even better.</p></div><div class="width40c width50c2 liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale40"><img class="promoimg21 in910" src="https://www.pcrichard.com/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-PCRichardSharedLibrary/default/dw3744730c/pim-content/tvs/SEO-1387_oled-TVs-img2_587x395.jpg" alt="" role="presentation"></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable" style="position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px;"><div class="width40c width50c2 liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale40"><img class="promoimg21 in910" src="https://www.pcrichard.com/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-PCRichardSharedLibrary/default/dw3744730c/pim-content/tvs/SEO-1387_oled-TVs_587x395.jpg" alt="" role="presentation"></div><div class="width60c width50c2 liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale60"><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h3 class="t-h5-style in910" style="color:#034694 !important" id="ocinsertcontent8058"><span style="color:#000">Which TV is Better LED or OLED?</span></h3></div><p id="ptag1942" style="font-size:null !important; color:null !important; " class="">As long as OLED TVs have been around, people have often asked how they compare to LED TVs. The short answer is that OLED TVs tend to beat out <a href="/led-tvs/" aria-label="LED TVs">LED TVs</a> in many categories, but it’s typically by a small margin, and it can vary depending on the specific TVs you’re looking at. Though OLED TVs typically display better overall visuals than your typical LED TV, with them being able to produce darker blacks being the biggest advantage, some specific LED TVs can compare very well to OLED TVs. <a href="/lg-tvs/" aria-label="LG ">LG </a>QNED TVs make use of Quantum Dots, which help improve the color quality of these TVs, and NanoCell technology, which further increases picture quality, to create a viewing experience that is quite close to what you get from an OLED TV. <a href="/qled-tvs/" aria-label="QLED TVs">QLED TVs</a> and <a href="/samsung-neo-qled-tvs/" aria-label="Samsung Neo QLED TVs">Samsung Neo QLED TVs</a> also use Quantum Dots, while the latter uses mini-LED technology as well which allows them to achieve better contrast and brightness than your average LED TV, making them a strong competitor for OLED TVs.</p></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 customspacer" style=""></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable ui-sortable-handle" style=""><div class="width50c width50c2 liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale50"><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h3 class="t-h5-style in910" style="color:#034694 !important" id="ocinsertcontent3809"><span style="color:#000">What are the Disadvantages of OLED TV?</span></h3></div><p id="ptag5631" style="font-size:null !important; color:null !important; ">Even though they are considered to be the best of the best when it comes to display technology, OLED TVs do come with one potential quirk. There is a small chance for burn in to happen on an OLED screen, which is when a permanent mark is made from one singular image being displayed on the screen for too long. This can happen from something like a channel logo, or a navigation button mostly. This is unlikely to happen, but it is important to note. They are also known to be fairly expensive when compared to other TVs, since they are considered to be top of the line.</p></div><div class="width50c width50c2 liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale50"><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h3 class="t-h5-style in910" style="color:#034694 !important" id="ocinsertcontent3833"><span style="color:#000" class="">What are the Best OLED TVs?</span></h3></div><p id="ptag3124" style="font-size:null !important; color:null !important; " class="">There are many great brands that make stunning OLED TVs.
