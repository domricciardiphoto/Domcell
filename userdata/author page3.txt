    <p id="ptag5494" style="font-size:null !important; color:null !important; " class="">Michael Morelli is one of our SEO copywriters, and has only recently begun his career
with P.C. Richard &amp; Son. He developed a passion for writing as early as high school,
and once he made it to Sacred Heart University he was able to leverage his writing
skills to get himself a degree in English with a minor in writing. Soon after he landed a
part time SEO job, where he learned the basics of the craft, before he found his way
onto the P.C.R team. His approach to writing SEO blog content revolves around a
combination of making the content entertaining, and utilizing a rich variety of keywords
to make something that is both fun to read, and drives search volume. He looks forward
to continuing his career at P.C.R and wants to learn even more about SEO along the
way.</p>
    <p id="ptag5686" style="font-size:null !important; color:null !important; " class="">When he’s not at work, Mike is frequently gaming, hanging out with his girlfriend,
exercising at the gym, and working on his creative novel. He also enjoys rooting for his
favorite League of Legends Esports team FlyQuest.</p>

started doing SEO as a part-time job. I started full time at PCR in 2022.</p><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h5-style in910" style="color:#000 !important; font-size:medium !important;" id="ocinsertcontent8817">How did you first become interested in writing? What path has your career taken that’s brought you here?</h2></div><p id="ptag2514" style="font-size:null !important; color:null !important; " class="">I’ve been interested in writing creatively since I was in early high school. I really enjoyed coming
up with and writing silly short stories about me and my friends and did try to write a serious sci-
fi novel back then, though it definitely needs a lot of work since I wrote it when I was kid haha. I
became interested in writing professionally in college. While there I was an English major and
took a writing minor, so I learned a lot about writing both creatively and professionally and was
given a number of opportunities to write serious academic papers about fun topics. Ultimately,
since I had started working with a startup marketing company part-time I learned a bit about
SEO writing and it matched up perfectly with a time when I was learning how to write in many
different ways. I enjoyed the part-time work and was able to take the knowledge I gained from
it to get a position here at PCR right out of college.</p><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h5-style in910" style="color:#000 !important; font-size:medium !important;" id="ocinsertcontent5358">In your opinion, what’s the most important element for a blog article?</h2></div><p id="ptag2919" style="font-size:null !important; color:null !important; ">In terms of trying to get eyes on it, the keywords are always extremely important. Though, once
the eyes are on it you need to make sure the blog is worth reading. Therefore, I feel that
keeping the blog relatable and entertaining, while still being informative, is important to retain
a reader.</p><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h5-style in910" style="color:#000 !important; font-size:medium !important;" id="ocinsertcontent5916">Have you ever received any awards or other recognition for your writing?</h2></div><p id="ptag5146" style="font-size:null !important; color:null !important; ">In college, I received a 2nd place award for my capstone paper about the way OCD, a mental
illness that I struggle with, is represented in popular media. It mainly compared two different
films (The Aviator/As Good as it Gets) where OCD is a prominent plot point and examined how
they present it while also sprinkling in my own experiences. Though I can’t specifically
remember what the award was called, I believe it was a competition, and I know it took
submissions from across the entire campus and I’m near positive I got 2nd.</p><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h5-style in910" style="color:#000 !important; font-size:medium !important;" id="ocinsertcontent4227">How long have you been with P.C.

I’ve been playing video games since I was a little kid on
my Nintendo, and I got into card games at a young age as well. I recently got into playing board
games with my friends and my girlfriend and it’s become a very fun hobby. I am also a huge comic and movie fan. There are few things I enjoy more than curling up on the couch with my girlfriend and watching a great movie or TV show. I also love a good night out at the local
breweries.</p><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h5-style in910" style="color:#000 !important; font-size:medium !important;" id="ocinsertcontent6048">Which hobby have you had the longest?</h2></div><p id="ptag5049" style="font-size:null !important; color:null !important; ">Definitely gaming. To add to what I said above, I was gaming as far back as I can remember with
some of my favorite and first games being older Pokémon games.</p><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h5-style in910" style="color:#000 !important; font-size:medium !important;" id="ocinsertcontent2699">Do you follow any sports?

Esports. I follow professional League of Legends closely, and my favorite team is called
FlyQuest, a North American team.</p><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h5-style in910" style="color:#000 !important; font-size:medium !important;" id="ocinsertcontent5038">Do you have your sights set on any long-term goals or accomplishments, career- wise or personal?</h2></div><p id="ptag5031" style="font-size:null !important; color:null !important; ">Professionally I think I’m still finding my footing and right now I’m just trying to learn as much
as I can about SEO writing and marketing in general. In terms of my personal life, I would truly
love to finish a novel I’ve been writing for a long time someday. It’s always been a dream of
mine. I’d also like to get married and start a family within a few years.</p>
