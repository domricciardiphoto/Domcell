With a refined contour, shorter stem, and quick-press controls for music or calls.<br><br>

<strong>ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLATION</strong><br>AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation help reduce outside noise before it reaches your ears, so you can immerse yourself in what you’re listening to.<br><br>

<strong>HEAR THE WORLD AROUND YOU</strong><br>The powerful H2 chip comes to AirPods 4. Adaptive Audio seamlessly blends Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode—which lets you comfortably hear and interact with the world around you exactly as it sounds—to provide the best listening experience in any environment. And when you’re speaking with someone nearby, Conversation Awareness automatically lowers the volume of what’s playing.<br><br>

<strong>IMPROVED SOUND AND CALL QUALITY</strong><br>Voice Isolation improves the quality of calls in loud conditions. Using advanced computational audio, it reduces background noise while isolating and clarifying the sound of your voice for whoever you’re speaking to.<br><br></div></div><div class="width50c width50c2 layoutpale layoutpale50 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width80c width50c2 liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale25"><strong>MAGICAL EXPERIENCE</strong><br>Just say “Siri” or “Hey Siri” to play a song, make a call, or check your schedule. And with Siri Interactions, now you can respond to Siri by simply nodding your head yes or shaking your head no. Pair AirPods 4 by simply placing them near your device and tapping Connect on your screen. Easily share a song or show between two sets of AirPods. A skin-detecting sensor knows to play audio only when you’re wearing AirPods and pauses when you take them off. And you can track down your AirPods and Charging Case with the Find My app.
PERSONALIZED SPATIAL AUDIO—Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking places sound all around you, creating a theater-like listening experience for music, TV shows, movies, games, and more.<br><br>

<strong>REDESIGNED CASE</strong><br>The Charging Case is the smallest in the industry with wireless charging. Charge with an Apple Watch charger, USB-C Charge Cable, or Qi-certified charger.<br><br>

<strong>LONG BATTERY LIFE</strong><br>With Active Noise Cancellation enabled, get up to 4 hours of listening time on a single charge and up to 20 hours using the case. And you can get up to 30 hours of total listening time without Active Noise Cancellation enabled.<br><br>

<strong>DUST, SWEAT, AND WATER RESISTANT</strong><br>AirPods 4 and the Charging Case are rated IP54 dust, sweat, and water resistant, so they’ll withstand rain and heavy workouts.<br><br></div></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 droppable ui-droppable customspacer ui-sortable-handle" style="min-height: 15px;"></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable hideonlyonmobile ui-sortable-handle" style=""><div class="width33c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale33" style="max-width: 69%; margin-left: 15.5%;"><div class="width100c"><img class="loading-lazy promoimg21 in910" src="https://edge.disstg.commercecloud.salesforce.com/dw/image/v2/BFXM_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-pcrichard-master-product-catalog/default/images/hires/AZ8_MXP93LL-A.jpg?sw=400&amp;sh=400&amp;sm=fit" data-src="https://edge.disstg.commercecloud.salesforce.com/dw/image/v2/BFXM_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-pcrichard-master-product-catalog/default/images/hires/AZ8_MXP93LL-A.jpg?sw=400&amp;sh=400&amp;sm=fit" alt="Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, model MXP93LL/A, what's in the box"></div></div><div class="program50c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale50" style="max-width: 97%; margin-left: 1.5%; margin-top: 39px;"><ul class="in910"><li class="">AirPods&nbsp;4 with Active Noise Cancellation</li><li class="">Charging Case (USB-C) with speaker</li><li class="">Documentation</li><li class="">(USB-C Charge Cable sold separately)</li></ul></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 droppable ui-droppable customspacer ui-sortable-handle" style="min-height: 14px;"></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable hideonlyondesktop ui-sortable-handle" style=""><div class="program50c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale50"><div class="width100c"><img class="loading-lazy promoimg21 in910" src="https://edge.disstg.commercecloud.salesforce.com/dw/image/v2/BFXM_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-pcrichard-master-product-catalog/default/images/hires/AZ8_MXP93LL-A.jpg?sw=400&amp;sh=400&amp;sm=fit" data-src="https://edge.disstg.commercecloud.salesforce.com/dw/image/v2/BFXM_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-pcrichard-master-product-catalog/default/images/hires/AZ8_MXP93LL-A.jpg?sw=400&amp;sh=400&amp;sm=fit" alt="Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, model MXP93LL/A, what's in the box"></div></div><div class="program50c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale50"><ul class="in910"><li class="">AirPods&nbsp;4 with Active Noise Cancellation</li><li class="">Charging Case (USB-C) with speaker</li><li class="">Documentation</li><li class="">(USB-C Charge Cable sold separately)</li></ul></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 droppable ui-droppable customspacer ui-sortable-handle" style="min-height: 15px;"></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable ui-sortable-handle" style=""><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100 explorerselected interedit"><sup><sub class="">1.
