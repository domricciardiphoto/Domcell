Laundry centers come with a stacked washer and a dryer. Though they are similar to stackable washers and dryers, these units are different because rather than being two separate machines on top of each other, the washer and dryer compartments on a laundry center are held together by one central control panel that manages both. Thhghjgvhjghjghghghs makes them one tall unit, rather than two smaller ones. As mentioned in the video, though these units tend to come with less bells and whistles than a traditional washer or dryer, they make up for it by being easy to use, and by being more convenient to store than a typical setup. As the video also mentions, gas laundry centers can help save you money in fuel costs in the long term when compared to an electric gas dryer.

All in one washer dryer combos are lone units that have one compartment that both washes and dries your clothing. As the video mentions, these units can be used virtually anywhere that has access to a 110V plug, and a cold water faucet, or sink. This eliminates the need for you to have a designated laundry area in your home, a portability kit for these machines would allow you to easily roll them away and store them when not in use, saving you space. As Pat pointed out in our video, without the need for a laundry hookup or a vent, this easy installation makes them great <a href="/whats-the-best-apartment-size-washer-and-dryer/Blog-9789.html">laundry machines for an apartment</a> or a tight space where you may not have these connections. The convenience of these units doesn’t end at their physical design either. All you’ll have to do to wash and dry your clothes in these machines is drop them in, set your two cycles, and let it go. You won’t need to come back and move your clothes over to a different machine once the wash cycle is complete. The drying cycle will simply begin once the clothes are done washing.
