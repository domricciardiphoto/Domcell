You'll obviously need a <a href="/desktop-computers/" aria-label="computer">computer</a> and a reliable internet connection, but other gear may be helpful too. If you're planning on doing video conferencing, a <a href="/webcams/" aria-label="webcam">webcam</a> is a good idea for the best high-quality images. You'll probably need a <a href="/computer-desks-workstations/" aria-label="desk">desk</a> and <a href="/office-chairs/" aria-label="office chair">office chair</a>, but if you prefer a more casual feel, a comfy armchair or even a beanbag chair may be your best bet. A <a href="/smart-speakers-displays/" aria-label="smart display or speaker">smart display or speaker</a> makes a great addition to your home office setup; use it not only for playing music (without headphones!), but also for creating reminders, setting a timer, and a variety of other tasks. <a href="/microsoft-surface-laptops/" aria-label="Microsoft Surface">Microsoft Surface</a> laptops have recently become popular in home offices due to their multifunctional use. </div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 droppable ui-droppable customspacer" style="min-height: 15px;"></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100"><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h4-style in910" style="color:#333 !important" id="ocinsertcontent3290">Designate a Spot</h2></div></div><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100">Distractions are a common concern about working from home, but there are plenty of ways to overcome them. One method is to figure out the most distraction-free spot of your home, and make that your "work zone." You'll be able to train your brain to associate that particular environment with working, making it easier to concentrate on your work tasks the moment you're in that particular space.</div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 droppable ui-droppable customspacer" style="min-height: 15px;"></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100"><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h4-style in910" style="color:#333 !important" id="ocinsertcontent8096">Use a Timer</h2></div></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100">Some people are great at time management, but others may struggle a bit, especially when they're new at being their own supervisor. A good way to keep yourself focused on a task is to set a timer for a small block of time, then devote your total attention to the task for the entire time. There's a tactic called the Pomodoro Technique that breaks down your day into 25-minute intervals with short breaks in between for taking a few laps around your home, grabbing a snack, or just enjoying some daydreaming. You'll feel better taking breaks if you're alternating them between manageable periods of head-down concentration.</div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 droppable ui-droppable customspacer" style="min-height: 15px;"></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100"><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h4-style in910" style="color:#333 !important" id="ocinsertcontent8326">Know When to Punch Out</h2></div></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100">When all the tools you need to get work done are right at your fingertips, it's tempting to dip in and out of work whenever you get a new idea or an urge to be productive. We admire your enthusiasm, but don't let work overtake your life. Once the end of the work day arrives and you're finished with the task at hand, leave your work zone and concentrate on something else. Enjoy some family time, watch a movie, or play a game - you've earned it! <br><br>
