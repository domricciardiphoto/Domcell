Is a convection oven the same as an air fryer? After all, hot air is hot air, right? Wrong! While there are some similarities to the ways in which they operate, air frying and convection baking are not interchangeable – they are two different techniques that offer different benefits and work best with different types of foods. We’re here to take a closer look at the distinctions between the two!</p></div></div><div class="pd-header-tag width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale  layoutpale100"><h2 class="t-h4-style" style="color: rgb(3, 70, 148);">How Do Air Fryers Work?</h2></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale  layoutpale100"><p>With food sitting in a metal basket rather than on a baking sheet, an <a href="/air-fryers/">air fryer</a> operates by shooting hot air downward and rapidly circulating it around all surfaces of the food simultaneously. This creates a chemical reaction called the Maillard (my-YAR) reaction, which produces the crispy texture that air frying is known for. The heat breaks down starches into sugars, which in turn react with amino acids. This sets off a rapid browning on the food surface, and hundreds of savory flavor compounds are created in the form of a crackly, thin, and delicious outer layer. An air fryer is specifically designed to use the Maillard reaction to create a crispy fried texture without actually frying!</p></div></div><div class="pd-header-tag width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale  layoutpale100"><h2 class="t-h4-style" style="color: rgb(3, 70, 148);">What Is a Convection Oven?</h2></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale  layoutpale100"><p>Unlike traditional baking where heat simply radiates from heating elements, a <a href="/convection-oven-ranges/">convection oven</a> consists of heating elements plus an interior fan. Instead of the heat shooting downward like in an air fryer, the fan is built into the oven’s rear wall. It circulates the hot air throughout the oven cavity, keeping it in constant motion for an even temperature throughout. Heating elements are located on the top and bottom of a convection oven, and a <a href="/ranges/">range</a> with True Convection utilizes a third heating element that’s around the fan. Foods that are cooked via convection are generally placed on baking sheets or in baking dishes. Rather than specifically getting a crispy exterior, convection can create a variety of textures depending on the food.</p></div></div><div class="pd-header-tag width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale  layoutpale100"><h2 class="t-h4-style" style="color: rgb(3, 70, 148);">What’s the Difference Between a Convection Oven vs Air Fryer?</h2></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale  layoutpale100"><p>While both of these cooking methods utilize the circulation of hot air, there are differences between the two.</p></div></div><ul><li>Air frying happens in a smaller space while convection baking makes use of an entire oven cavity. This means air frying requires a shorter preheating time as well as a shorter cook time.</li><li>Air-fried foods are placed in a basket to allow air to circulate evenly over the entire surface. Most convection baking is done on a sheet or in a pan, which means the bottom of the food is exposed to different conditions than the top.  </li><li>While air frying offers spectacular results on a select variety of foods, there are some limits on what can be air fried due to the basket rather than a pan. For example, batter-dipped foods are a no-go for air frying, as are foods that are excessively cheesy. </li><li>Convection works better for foods that require a more protracted baking process, like breads or roasts. Air frying is a better option for smaller-scale cooking like appetizers and snacks.</li></ul><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale  layoutpale100"><p>When you’ve got a thorough understanding of all the cooking options available to you, you’ll be able to make the right choice to get the best results possible. Experimenting with convection as well as air frying will allow you to see the differences for yourself, and determine the method that works best for your favorites. Good luck, and bon appetit!</p></div></div></div></div>
