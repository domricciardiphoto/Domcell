    <h3><strong class="">Large Pull Out Freezers</strong></h3>
    As seen in our video, on the bottom of many French door refrigerators you’ll find a large, pull-out freezer that can handle storing all of your frozen foods. With a roll out design, these freezers are easy to use when your hands are full with groceries. Most models come with multiple racks that can accommodate differently sized items, so it should be simple to organize your freezer. Some models even come with an extra middle drawer, or even multiple drawers, between your fridge and freezer that can be set to whatever temperature you want, giving you even more storage for your frozen food, or a nice place to store specific food items.

    <h3 class=""><strong class="">Two Doors</strong> </h3>As Pat demonstrates below, nearly every French door refrigerator comes with two large doors that have a small swing radius. This means that you can easily fit this fridge in a spot with limited depth, since the fridge doesn’t need a lot of space to swing open. That’s why you'll find a number of <a href="/counter-depth-french-door-refrigerators/">counter-depth French door refrigerators</a> out there, since they are built to sit more in line with your cabinets. Of course, behind these two doors is a ton of fridge space.

    French door refrigerators are often some of the most feature rich refrigerators you can find. Some common models you'll find out there are <a href="/ice-dispenser-french-door-refrigerators/">French door refrigerators with an ice dispenser</a>. As you can tell by their names, these refrigerators come with an ice dispenser that can give you some ice cubes whenever you need them. There are also many different <a href="/smart-french-door-refrigerators/">smart French door refrigerators</a>. Though the features you'll find on these fridges will vary, typically these models can connect to WiFi, and be managed through an app on your smartphone. This will sometimes allow you to adjust the temperature in the fridge remotely, see if the door was left open by mistake, or see the general status of the fridge.
