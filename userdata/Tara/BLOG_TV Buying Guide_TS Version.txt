<p class="">An important first step in choosing a television is selecting the proper screen dimensions. A good metric for television sizing is ten inches of screen for every foot of viewing distance. For example, if you'll be sitting five feet away from your TV, a 50" TV screen is roughly where you'd like to be; go much smaller, and you won't get the best viewing experience. Measure the distance between your television's future home and the spot from which you'll be viewing it most often, and use that to determine the optimal size of your new TV. If you've got a large living room, we've got good news: Large-screen televisions like a <a href="/85-inch-larger-tvs/" aria-label="75&quot; TV, 85&quot; TV and larger">75" TV, 85" TV and larger</a> are now more accessible than ever, both in terms of selection as well as affordability. Even a 98" or 100” TV can be attainable if you shop during the right sale. Don't forget that a large screen will truly allow you to take in the superior detail that a high-resolution TV provides. For smaller spaces like a kitchen or small bedroom, a 32-inch TV is a common choice. When looking for a TV for your home, don’t hesitate to peruse all the options. You may be pleasantly surprised!</p></div></div></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100"><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h4-style in910" style="color:#333 !important" id="ocinsertcontent4921">Screen Resolution</h2></div></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100"><strong class=""><a href="/4k-ultra-hd-tvs/" aria-label="4K Ultra HD TV">4K Ultra HD TV</a></strong>- Boasting a screen with more than eight million pixels, a 4K television displays images at four times the resolution of a conventional HD television. As of this writing, 4K-resolution entertainment can be found on streaming services like Netflix or Hulu, Prime Video, and more! Many 4K televisions can also automatically upconvert lower-resolution content into a more highly-detailed picture. A 4K TV is much more mainstream than it was a few years ago, so don't hesitate to keep your sizing options open. You may be able to go larger than you think! <br><br>

<strong class=""><a href="/8k-ultra-hd-tvs/" aria-label="8K Ultra HD TV">8K Ultra HD TV</a></strong> - These screens display four times the resolution of 4K and sixteen times the pixels of HD for a total of 33 million pixels. Modern gaming consoles like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 are both capable of running your games at 8K. This means if you're a gamer who values visuals and you want to get the most out of your console, there's no beating an 8K TV. Just remember that you'll need an ultra-premium certified <a href="/hdmi-cables/" aria-label="HDMI cable">HDMI cable</a> to connect your various devices to an 8K TV correctly and to have your content actually appear in 8K quality. It's not every day you buy a new TV, so going for the higher resolution will keep your technology more up to date for a longer time.<br><br>

HDR TV (High Dynamic Range) - While we are including it under the "Resolution" heading, HDR is a feature that has more to do with contrast range than it does with resolution. These screens produce a wider color spectrum, enhancing the individual pixels to present a more dramatic range of color and a higher contrast between light and dark. The information to produce an HDR image is encoded directly in its video signal; while a regular TV simply ignores this metadata, HDR TVs have the capability to read it and give the image the high-contrast look its creators intended. As of writing, the best form of HDR is Dolby Vision, which is able to add even more detail and color quality to all of your favorite content.

<strong class=""><a href="/gaming-tvs/" aria-label="Gaming TV">Gaming TV</a></strong> - Gaming TVs are designed to be able to handle the demands of your most powerful gaming system. While gaming TVs bring many amazing features to the table, they are mainly known for their high refresh rates. If your TV has a high refresh rate, it will be able to display more images per second on its screen. This means you'll experience less lag in your favorite video games, or even while you're watching your favorite sport. Most gaming TVs have anywhere between a 60Hz refresh rate and a 120Hz refresh rate which are both considered to be solid numbers when it comes to gaming. If you really want a premium gaming experience, then you can even find TVs with 144Hz refresh rates, allowing you to have even less lag, making your gaming session even smoother. <br><br></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100"><div style="flex: 0 1 auto; max-width:50%;padding: 3%;float:left;" class=""><img class="loading-lazy promoimg21 in910" alt="tv-buying-guide-oled.jpg" src="https://staging-na01-pcrichard.demandware.net/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-pcrichard-master-articles-catalog/default/images/blog/tv-buying-guide-oled.jpg?sw=400&amp;sh=400&amp;sm=fit" data-src="https://staging-na01-pcrichard.demandware.net/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-pcrichard-master-articles-catalog/default/images/blog/tv-buying-guide-oled.jpg?sw=400&amp;sh=400&amp;sm=fit"></div><div style="align-items: flex-start;" class=""><div style="flex: 1 1 auto" class="">

<h3 class="t-h4-style in910" style="color:#034694 !important" id="ocinsertcontent9330"><span style="color:#000" class=""><strong>Types of OLED TVs</strong></span></h3>

<p class="">
Standard OLED TV (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) - The screen of an OLED television is made up of millions of diodes in the form of pixels. What's unique about this type of television is that each individual pixel is self-lighting; in addition to dimming and brightening, the pixels can actually switch on and off. This produces the darkest black possible, creating superior contrast and colors that truly stand out. <br><br>

QD-OLED TV - The QD in QD-OLED stands for quantum dot. The quantum dot layer inside this TV screen enhances images with greater brightness and a color spectrum of over a billion shades. This quantum dot layer works in tandem with the OLED self-illuminating pixels to create even brighter colors alongside true black, bringing you dazzling images every time you turn on your TV.<br><br>

</p><h3 class="t-h4-style in910" style="color:#034694 !important" id="ocinsertcontent9330"><span style="color:#000" class=""><strong>Types of LED TVs</strong></span></h3>

<br>
Standard LED TV (Light-Emitting Diode) - LED actually refers to the screen's light source rather than the image itself; the LED is what provides the television's backlighting. There are different types of TV LED screens; an Edge Lit LED TV has its lights along the edge of the screen, while a Backlit LED obviously has the lights arranged behind the screen. Another style of backlit TV is a Full Array LED TV, available on select models of LED and QLED televisions. Instead of uniform illumination, a full array screen has hundreds of independently-operated LED lights spread throughout. This allows for pinpointed dimming and brightening on isolated parts of the screen, improving contrast and creating more lifelike images.<br><br>

<a href="/qled-tvs/" aria-label="QLED TV">QLED TV</a> (Quantum Dot LED) - The QLED TV is another kind of TV that makes use of a quantum dot layer. These TVs still rely on the LED backlight for a light source, but the quantum dot layer enhances the detail of the onscreen image itself. The QLED screen also allows clear visibility from every angle and is designed to keep glare to an absolute minimum.<br><br>

QNED TV (Quantum Nano-Emitting Diode) – Though they are similar to QLED TVs, QNED TVs are a special type of TV from LG that combine both the quantum dot technology mentioned above, and LG’s very own NanoCell technology. NanoCell tech blocks out excess light and generally enhances the contrast of these TVs, while the quantum dots work to create vibrant colors. With these two pieces of technology working together you’ll end up with astounding visuals. To get a more thorough rundown on QNED TVs check out our blog: QNED: The LED TV with Amazing Color and Lots More.<br><br>

Mini-LED TV - Mini LED TVs, as their name implies, make use of smaller LEDs to light up their screens which allows them to have more individual lights than a standard LED TV. This grants them both greater contrast and image quality as typically more LEDs means more brightness control. With all of these features, you'll notice greater contrast and exceptional brightness to better immerse you in your favorite movies and TV shows. <br><br>

Neo QLED TVs – These TVs are made by Samsung and leverage the mini-LED and the Quantum Dot technology from above. The mini-LEDs help optimize the brighness and contrast of these TVs, while the Quantum Dots help add more detail to everything on screen. They’re important to note as they use these two technologies to the fullest extent, giving you amazing visuals, and a great viewing experience.

Many outdoor TV models have also started to include smart functionality, making it easier than ever to stream your favorite movies and TV shows outdoors. There are multiple different types of outdoor televisions to consider, and the type that's best for you will depend on where you intend on putting the TV. A full sun outdoor TV offers the brightest possible display; designed to be anti-glare even on the sunniest days, these models are ideal for placement near a pool or other active outdoor area. A partial sun outdoor TV functions well in a spot with occasional shade that still gets sunlight at certain times of day, like a patio or veranda. Full shade outdoor TVs are made to be placed in areas with no direct sunlight; their brightness levels are still higher than your average indoor TV, but they're best suited for shady areas. In other words, you’re going to want to choose an option that best suits the spot you plan on putting your TV in. The amount of sun exposure should match the TV type.</div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 customspacer" style="min-height: 15px;"></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100"><div class="pd-header-tag width100c"><h2 class="t-h4-style in910" style="color:#333 !important" id="ocinsertcontent7292">TV Accessories</h2></div></div></div><div class="width100c layoutpale layoutpale100 liverow droppable ui-droppable"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100">There are a number of <a href="/tv-home-theater-accessories/" aria-label="TV accessories">TV accessories</a> out there that you should own to make your setup even better.

<a href="/soundbars/" aria-label="Soundbars">Soundbars</a> - A great pair of speakers, or a high-quality soundbar can really help amp up your TV’s sound quality!

These devices can provide you with the audio quality that your favorite TV shows and movies deserve.

Do bear in mind that HDMI cables have also come a long way over the years. Your cable from a few years ago might not be quite as effective as a new one, especially if you plan on using it for something like gaming.

<a href="/tv-antennas/" aria-label="Antennas">Antennas</a> - You read right, TV antennas are actually still used today, and with good reason!

<a href="/universal-remote-controls/" aria-label="Remotes">Remotes</a> - Everyone’s lost a TV remote at one point or another.
