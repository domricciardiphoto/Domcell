If you have a young child who needs formula, or another family member with dietary restrictions, then make sure you pack whatever extra items you need. Multivitamins are always a good thing to have around too.<br><br>

In addition to the comprehensive first aid kit described above, all of your kits should have small individual first aid packs that include the basic first aid supplies and a first aid manual. Check out small camping first aid kits for purchase, or for an idea of how to assemble one yourself. Remember to think of the individuals in your household. Does anyone require specific medications? Be sure to add that to their kit.<br><br>

Having some of the things mentioned earlier can be helpful on the go, like <a href="/flashlights/" aria-label="flashlights">flashlights</a> and <a href="/audio-players/" aria-label="AM/FM radio">AM/FM radio</a>. A pocketknife or multi-tool can be helpful in a pinch, and a can opener for your canned food is also a necessity. You can also invest in an instant pop-up shelter or tube tent if you need to spend the night outdoors, or space blankets at least. You’re also going to want some personal toiletries, for comfort of course. Some other things to consider are extra weather-specific clothes, diapers, feminine hygiene products, and toothpaste and toothbrushes. If you have pets with you, then make sure you bring some supplies for them, like kibble, extra water, a bowl, a crate, and any medications they may need. It’s always great to bring extra cash, a list of emergency phone numbers, a map of the local area, and your important documents in your bag too. <br><br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="width100c ui-sortable-handle" style="cursor: grab;"><div class="width50c width50c2 layoutpale layoutpale50 liverow droppable ui-droppable hideonlyondesktop"><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100"><img class="loading-lazy promoimg21 in910" src="https://www.pcrichard.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-pcrichard-master-articles-catalog/default/images//blog/additional_supplies_528x396.jpg" data-src="https://www.pcrichard.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-pcrichard-master-articles-catalog/default/images//blog/additional_supplies_528x396.jpg" alt="Additional Emergency Preparedness Supplies"></div><div class="width100c liveelement in910 layoutpale layoutpale100"><strong>Additional Supplies</strong> <br>

In emergency situations, local officials and relief workers will be on the scene, but they cannot reach everyone immediately. You could get help in a few hours, or it could take days, and that is why it's so important to be prepared. <br><br>
