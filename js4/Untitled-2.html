    <p>No one wants to think about the next big storm, flood or emergency that could leave you and your family without
        power or trapped within your home. That's why it's so important to be prepared for anything and everything -
        even the zombie apocalypse! Yes, we know the chances of the walking dead happening is pretty much zero, but when
        it comes to any disaster, it never hurts to be over-prepared.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>In any disaster scenario, it's important to have a well-stocked emergency survival kit and a backup power source.
        Check out our disaster preparedness guide for a complete list of supplies to have on-hand in case an emergency
        arises.</p>

    <h2>How to Prepare for a Power Outage</h2>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>One of the most common issues that arise during a bad storm or heat wave is a power outage. Consider investing in
        a portable <a href="$url('Search-Show','cgid',001-004-004-001)$" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generator</a> to
        help support most, if not all, of your home's power needs. For those with health issues that rely on
        electric-powered machinery, it could be a lifesaver, but you need to make sure you know <a
            href="/generator-safety-tips-dos-donts-you-need-to-know/Blog-4879.html">how to use a generator safely</a>.
    </p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>If you don't have a generator or your residence doesn't permit the use of one, there are other supplies that will
        aid you when the lights go out. Here are some basic supplies you should keep in your home in case of a power
        outage:</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <ul>
        <li> <a href="/flashlights/">Flashlights</a></li>

    <h2 class="western">What to Pack in a First Aid Kit</h2>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>Even if there isn't a disaster, it's important to always have a well-stocked first aid kit on hand. You may not
        always be able to get medical attention quickly and may need to address injuries on your own until you can
        access help. Minor injuries could become worse if not properly and immediately treated.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>Here are some basic first aid kit supplies:</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"className":"western"} -->
    <h3 class="western">Medicine for Treating Injuries</h3>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:list -->
    <ul>
        <li>Antiseptic solution or wipes</li>
        <li>Antibiotic ointment that contains ingredients such as bacitracin or mupirocin</li>
        <li>Sterile eyewash or saline, such as contact lens saline solution</li>
        <li>Calamine lotion for stings or poison ivy</li>
        <li>Hydrocortisone cream, ointment or lotion for itching</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- /wp:list -->

    <!-- wp:heading -->
    <h2>Other Medicines</h2>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:list -->
    <ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>Keep in mind that some members of your household may have unique needs, specifically your children or older
        relatives. Does anyone in your household have specific allergies or an illness? Add supplies specific to these
        conditions. Be sure to check your supply kit monthly, refill as needed and check expiration dates on medication.
    </p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:heading {"className":"western"} -->
    <h2 class="western">What is a Bug-Out Bag?</h2>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>Bug-out bag is just another term for an emergency supply kit, or a go bag, that could help you survive if you
        need to evacuate, or bug-out, in the event of a disaster. This 72-hour pack is a grab-and-go disaster
        preparedness kit that usually contains enough essentials to last three days. Below is a convenient list of
        everything you will need for the perfect bug-out bag.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"className":"western"} -->
    <h3 class="western">Quality Backpack</h3>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>It's important to make sure you can actually carry what you pack, especially if you need to be agile in a flood.
        Backpacks make a great option for stashing supplies because they leave your arms free and balance the weight of
        the load on your back for easier carrying. You need one for yourself and one for each member of your household,
        with enough storage capacity for three days' worth of supplies for everyone. Don't forget your pets, too!</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"className":"western"} -->
    <h3 class="western">Water</h3>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>FEMA recommends three gallons of water per person to last 72 hours. However, that recommendation includes
        cleaning water as well as drinking water. Three gallons of water weighs 25 pounds and that's a lot to carry.
        Consider purchasing a two-gallon water carry bag, making it less weight and easier to store. You may also want
        to consider something with electrolytes and carbohydrates like Gatorade or Powerade.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"className":"western"} -->
    <h3 class="western">Food</h3>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>You will want to pack non-perishable items with far-off expiration dates, such as:</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:list -->
    <ul>
        <li>Peanut butter</li>
        <li>Whole wheat crackers</li>
        <li>Nuts and trail mix</li>
        <li>Cereal</li>
        <li>Granola bars and power/protein bars</li>
        <li>Dried fruit</li>
        <li>Canned tuna, salmon, chicken or turkey</li>
        <li>Canned vegetables</li>
        <li>Canned soups</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- /wp:list -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>Make adjustments to the food you pack for each individual's kit. Maybe you have an infant who requires formula,
        or a child that has specific allergies to certain foods. Remember to check expiration dates every six months on
        the food you've packed and replace as needed. You may want to consider packing some multivitamins as well.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"className":"western"} -->
    <h3 class="western">First Aid</h3>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>In addition to the comprehensive first aid kit described above, all of your kits should have small individual
        first aid packs that include the basic first aid supplies and a first aid manual. Check out <a
            href="First-Aid-Product.com: Small Camping Outdoor First Aid Kits - Pocket-Sized First Aid Kits,... "
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">small camping first aid kits</a> for purchase, or for an idea of how to
        assemble one yourself. Remember to think of the individuals in your household. Does anyone require specific
        medications? Be sure to add that to their kit.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"className":"western"} -->
    <h3 class="western">Additional Supplies</h3>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><b><a href="/flashlights/">Flashlights</a> </b>- Put small, water-resistant flashlights in everyone's packs.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><b><a href="/audio-players/">AM/FM Radio</a></b> - Either battery-operated or hand-cranked models will work. You
        do not need to store a radio in everyone's pack if you plan to be together. One per family is fine.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><b>Pocket Knife/Multi-Tool</b> - It's always good to have at least one per family.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p><b>Can Opener</b> - If you packed canned food, you will need this!</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>We hope this guide will help you get started with preparing you and your family for a possible disaster. In
        emergency situations, local officials and relief workers will be on the scene, but they cannot reach everyone
        immediately. You could get help in a few hours, or it could take days, and that is why it's so important to be
        prepared.
